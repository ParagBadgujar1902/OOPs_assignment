        "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — Assignment Answers\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around *objects* — entities that combine state (data) and behavior (methods). OOP models real-world concepts using **classes** (blueprints) and **objects** (instances). Key principles: **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **class** is a blueprint or template defining attributes (data) and methods (functions) for objects. It specifies how objects of that type behave and what data they hold.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Hi, I'm {self.name}.\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An **object** is an instance of a class — a concrete realization of the class blueprint with actual values for its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "p = Person('Asha', 22)  # p is an object (instance)\n",
        "print(p.greet())\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features. It’s about *what* an object does.\n",
        "* **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods inside a class and restricting direct access to some components (using access conventions). It’s about *protecting* object state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A `Car` class abstracts driving behavior; it encapsulates internal state like engine details.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dunder methods** (double-underscore methods) are special methods with names like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__call__`. They let objects interact with Python’s built-in operations (construction, printing, calling, arithmetic, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance** allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It enables code reuse and hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return '...'\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return 'Woof'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism** means \"many forms\": different classes provide different implementations of the same method name, so the same call works on different object types. It enables writing generic code that works with objects of different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses naming conventions to indicate access:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Public: `attr`\n",
        "* Protected (convention): `_attr` (single underscore)\n",
        "* Private name-mangling: `__attr` (double underscore)\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is implemented by keeping attributes private (or protected) and providing getter/setter methods or properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, bal):\n",
        "        self.__balance = bal\n",
        "    def deposit(self, amt):\n",
        "        self.__balance += amt\n",
        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **constructor** is the `__init__` method in Python. It's called when a new object is created and initializes the object’s attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class C:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, x):\n",
        "        self.x = x\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* `@classmethod`: receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument. Can access/modify class state.\n",
        "* `@staticmethod`: does not receive `self` or `cls`. It’s like a regular function namespaced in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    count = 0\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        A.count += 1\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def get_count(cls):\n",
        "        return cls.count\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def util(x):\n",
        "        return x * 2\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does **not** support traditional compile-time method overloading (multiple methods with the same name and different signatures). Instead, you can:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use default arguments or `*args, **kwargs`.\n",
        "* Inspect argument types/number at runtime and behave accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Calc:\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b, c=0):\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method overriding** occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class. The subclass’s version is used for its instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "`@property` turns a method into a read-only attribute-like access. Combine with `@<name>.setter` to provide setter behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Rectangle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, w, h):\n",
        "        self._w = w; self._h = h\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def area(self):\n",
        "        return self._w * self._h\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism improves code flexibility and reuse. It allows generic code to operate on objects of different types, promoting extensibility and reducing conditional logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated and typically includes one or more abstract methods. In Python, use `abc.ABC` and `@abstractmethod` to define abstract methods that subclasses must implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "class Shape(ABC):\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def area(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Modularity and code organization\n",
        "* Reusability via inheritance\n",
        "* Maintainability and easier debugging\n",
        "* Encapsulation provides data protection\n",
        "* Easier mapping to real-world problems\n",
        "\n",
        "## 17. Difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Class variable**: Shared across all instances of the class.\n",
        "* **Instance variable**: Unique to each object instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    shared = []  # class variable\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.local = []  # instance variable\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multiple inheritance** allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. Python resolves conflicts using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A: pass\n",
        "class B: pass\n",
        "class C(A, B): pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 19. Purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__str__`: Human-readable string representation (used by `print()`).\n",
        "* `__repr__`: Official representation intended for debugging; ideally a valid Python expression that recreates the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class P:\n",
        "    def __repr__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"P({self.x!r})\"\n",
        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"P with x={self.x}\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 20. Significance of the `super()` function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "`super()` accesses methods from a parent class, commonly used to call the parent’s `__init__` or other methods from inside a child class to extend behavior without re-implementing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Base:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, x):\n",
        "        self.x = x\n",
        "class Child(Base):\n",
        "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
        "        super().__init__(x)\n",
        "        self.y = y\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 21. Significance of the `__del__` method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "`__del__` is the destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage-collected). Its use is discouraged for complex cleanup because timing of garbage collection is not guaranteed; prefer context managers (`with`) for deterministic resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 22. Difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "(See question 10):\n",
        "\n",
        "* `@staticmethod`: no access to class or instance. Utility function.\n",
        "* `@classmethod`: receives `cls`, can access class variables and other classmethods.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "If multiple subclasses implement the same method name (e.g., `speak()`), code that calls `obj.speak()` will invoke the appropriate implementation depending on `obj`’s runtime type. This is dynamic (runtime) polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
        "for a in animals:\n",
        "    print(a.speak())  # correct method for each object\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method chaining** returns `self` from methods so multiple calls can be linked in one expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Builder:\n",
        "    def __init__(self): self.parts = []\n",
        "    def add(self, p):\n",
        "        self.parts.append(p)\n",
        "        return self\n",

        "## 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "`__call__` makes an instance callable like a function. When defined, `obj()` invokes `obj.__call__()`.\n",
        "\n",
